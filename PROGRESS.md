# Project Progress Documentation

## Overview
This document outlines the progress made on the "logical" repository, specifically on the 'devin-0' branch. The goal is to develop 1000 logical English examples, determine their truth values, and create corresponding Prolog statements and a test runner to validate these truth values.

## Tasks Completed
- Reviewed the "logical" repository and corrected file path definitions in `storage.py`.
- Verified the creation of `myprolog.csv` and determined the current count of logical examples.
- Developed the `generate_examples.py` script to automate the generation of logical English examples.
- Fixed assertion errors in the `test_validate_logical_statement` function within `generate_examples.py`.
- Enhanced the `generate_examples.py` script to use parsing functions from `__init__.py` for generating Prolog statements.
- Implemented a Prolog test runner script (`test_runner.pl`) to validate the truth values of logical statements.
- Regularly committed and pushed changes to the remote repository to ensure progress is tracked and saved.

## Scripts Functionality
- `generate_examples.py`: Automates the generation of logical English examples and their corresponding Prolog statements. It includes validation checks and ensures uniqueness of generated statements.
- `test_runner.pl`: A Prolog script that loads Prolog statements from `myprolog.csv`, parses each statement, and executes it to validate its truth value.

## Important Notes
- The `validate_logical_statement` function in `generate_examples.py` has been refined to correctly handle simple logical statements.
- The `parse_logic` function in `__init__.py` is used to convert English statements into Prolog format, which is then integrated into the `generate_examples.py` script.
- The Prolog test runner script is designed to be run using the SWI-Prolog compiler with the command `swipl -s test_runner.pl -g run_tests -t halt`.

## Next Steps
- Document the process and progress to facilitate future reviews.
- Prepare for the creation of a pull request to merge the completed work into the main branch of the repository.

## How to Run Tests Manually
To run the Prolog tests manually, navigate to the `/home/ubuntu/logical/logical` directory and execute the following command:
```
swipl -s test_runner.pl -g run_tests -t halt
```
This will run the test runner script and output the results of each test.

## Commit History Reference
- Commit messages have been descriptive to provide context for each set of changes made.
- Regular commits have been made to ensure that the work is saved and can be reviewed at any point.

## Pull Request Preparation
- Ensure that all tests pass and the code is clean and well-documented before creating a pull request.
- The pull request will include a summary of the changes made and the purpose of the changes for the reviewer's context.
