% Assumption to handle potential logical inconsistency. In practice, this set of statements
% results in a contradiction because if J is taller than X, X taller than D and D taller than J,
% then it cannot satisfy the circular taller relation in a consistent way.

% Circular contradiction resolution can be handled by additional clauses such as:
% detection of inconsistency, or enforcement of acyclicity in the taller relationships.
% Therefore, let's add a preventive rule to check inconsistency:

inconsistent :- taller(A, B), taller(B, C), taller(C, A).

% This rule can be used to detect inconsistency:
% ?- inconsistent. would return true in this case, indicating a logical inconsistency.
